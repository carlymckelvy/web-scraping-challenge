# web-scraping-challenge

This project started with a Jupyter Notebook called `mission_to_mars.ipynb`, which was used to scrape data from several space-related websites, then store the information necessary to access certain data.  The notebook was converted into Python script and saved as `scrape_mars.py`.  Next, an `app.py` file was created with routes to scrape import the `scrape_mars.py` file and call the scrape function, as well as a route to query the Mongo database and pass the data into an HTML template.  The `index.html` file takes this data and displays it as designed.  To design the HTML layout, I used www.layitout.com.  These files can all be found in the `Mission_to_Mars` folder.
